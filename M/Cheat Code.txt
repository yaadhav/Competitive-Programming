Input and output:

Input and output is sometimes a bottleneck in the program. The following 
lines at the beginning of the code make input and output more efficient:

    ios::sync_with_stdio(0);
    cin.tie(0);


Shortening code:

Using the command typedef 

    //typedef long long ll;
    //typedef vector<int> vi;

    long long a = 123456789;
    vector<int> v;
    can be shortened as follows:
    ll a = 123456789;
    vi v;    

Macros:

A macro means that certain strings in the code will be changed before the compilation. 
In C++, macros are defined using the #define keyword.

    //#define pb push_back
    //#define for(i,a,b) for (int i = a; i <= b; i++)

    After this, the code
    v.push_back(x);
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
    search(i);
    }
    can be shortened as follows:
    v.pb(x);
    for(i,1,n) {
    search(i);
    }
